# IGT-Training



Hello, Good Morning Sir/Madam,

My name is Shailesh Pal, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Matoshri College of Engineering.

I have a strong understanding of Java, Python, Web Development, Data Analytics, Database Management, and Software Development. I enjoy solving problems through coding and always look for opportunities to improve my skills.

During my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that helped me gain hands-on experience:

Virtual Voice Assistant – A system that listens to voice commands and helps users complete different tasks.

Real-time Sign Language Translation – A project that converts sign language gestures into text or speech instantly, making communication easier for people with hearing disabilities.

Apart from coding, I enjoy playing cricket and exploring new places. Cricket has taught me teamwork and patience, while traveling helps me learn new things and meet different people.

I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to the interview. Thank you for your time!
